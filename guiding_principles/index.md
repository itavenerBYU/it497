# Guiding Principles

These guiding principles reflect the values that shape my approach to work, service, and ethical decision-making. Informed by faith and experience, they provide a practical framework for how I manage responsibility, serve others, and pursue long-term professional growth.

### 1. Faithful Stewardship

I believe that I am accountable for how I manage what has been entrusted to me. This includes temporal resources such as finances and time, as well as intangible responsibilities such as access, authority, and trust.

Over time, my understanding of stewardship has matured significantly. I have come to see stewardship not simply as efficient management, but as a moral responsibility that requires restraint, foresight, and accountability. This perspective has influenced how I approach financial decisions, long-term planning, and the responsibilities I carry for my family. Stewardship, as I understand it, involves acting faithfully even when outcomes are uncertain, and making choices that prioritize stability, integrity, and the well-being of others over short-term convenience.

This principle carries directly into my professional life. In my role as a Service Desk Technician, I am entrusted with sensitive systems, user identities, and access that could easily be misused if handled carelessly. Whether I am implementing security controls or responding to requests for technical assistance, I am constantly reminded that my role is fundamentally about stewardship. Accepting shortcuts may resolve immediate issues, but it can weaken trust and undermine long-term security culture. My commitment to faithful stewardship shapes how I approach ethical decisions, even when doing so requires additional effort or causes inconvenience.

### 2. Professional Service

I view my work as an opportunity to serve, and I believe that professionalism is one of the primary ways compassion is expressed in environments that demand structure, accountability, and precision.

My understanding of service has become more disciplined and deliberate. I no longer associate service with visibility or recognition, but with quiet consistency and a genuine focus on the well-being of others. This perspective has shaped how I communicate, how I listen, and how I approach responsibility. In professional settings, it guides how I interact with colleagues and those I support, emphasizing patience, respect, and thoughtful follow-through.

In my daily work, I regularly assist individuals who feel frustrated, embarrassed, or overwhelmed by technical issues. I have learned that competence alone is not enough. How I respond, communicate, and preserve dignity matters just as much as resolving the issue itself. This principle has also guided my leadership in larger initiatives, such as training colleagues and supporting organization-wide technology changes. I strive to balance empathy with clarity, ensuring that service remains both compassionate and effective.

This principle explains why I value preparation, clear communication, and follow-through. Compassion without professionalism can become enabling. Professionalism without compassion can become impersonal. I seek to hold both together in my work and service.

### 3. Discipleship
I have learned that obedience to God is the foundation of both my spiritual growth and my ability to lead and act ethically in professional settings.

As I have placed greater emphasis on obedience, I have experienced a clear shift in how I approach responsibility, authority, and personal discipline. Obedience has brought greater clarity of purpose and a stronger sense of direction in both my spiritual and professional life. Rather than seeking convenience or immediate results, I have learned to act with intention, patience, and trust in long-term outcomes.

This principle shapes how I respond to correction, how I adhere to ethical and organizational boundaries, and how I approach leadership opportunities. I do not view obedience as passivity, but as a foundation for deliberate and principled action. In fields such as information security and digital forensics, where credibility and integrity are essential, this orientation provides a stable moral framework for decision-making.

Obedient discipleship orders my other principles. It strengthens my commitment to stewardship and gives purpose to my service, ensuring that both remain aligned with enduring values rather than momentary pressures.
