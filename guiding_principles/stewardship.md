# Faithful Stewardship of Trust and Resources

I believe that I am accountable to God and to others for how I manage what has been entrusted to me. This includes temporal resources such as finances and time, as well as intangible responsibilities such as access, authority, and trust.

Over time, my understanding of stewardship has matured significantly. I have come to see stewardship not simply as efficient management, but as a moral responsibility that requires restraint, foresight, and accountability. This perspective has influenced how I approach financial decisions, long-term planning, and the responsibilities I carry for my family. Stewardship, as I understand it, involves acting faithfully even when outcomes are uncertain, and making choices that prioritize stability, integrity, and the well-being of others over short-term convenience.

This principle carries directly into my professional life. In my role as a Service Desk Technician, I am entrusted with sensitive systems, user identities, and access that could easily be misused if handled carelessly. Whether I am implementing security controls or responding to requests for technical assistance, I am constantly reminded that my role is fundamentally about stewardship. Accepting shortcuts may resolve immediate issues, but it can weaken trust and undermine long-term security culture. My commitment to faithful stewardship shapes how I approach ethical decisions, even when doing so requires additional effort or causes inconvenience.
