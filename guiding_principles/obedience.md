# Obedient Discipleship as the Source of Growth and Authority

I have learned that obedience to God is the foundation of both my spiritual growth and my ability to lead and act ethically in professional settings.

As I have placed greater emphasis on obedience, I have experienced a clear shift in how I approach responsibility, authority, and personal discipline. Obedience has brought greater clarity of purpose and a stronger sense of direction in both my spiritual and professional life. Rather than seeking convenience or immediate results, I have learned to act with intention, patience, and trust in long-term outcomes.

This principle shapes how I respond to correction, how I adhere to ethical and organizational boundaries, and how I approach leadership opportunities. I do not view obedience as passivity, but as a foundation for deliberate and principled action. In fields such as information security and digital forensics, where credibility and integrity are essential, this orientation provides a stable moral framework for decision-making.

Obedient discipleship orders my other principles. It strengthens my commitment to stewardship and gives purpose to my service, ensuring that both remain aligned with enduring values rather than momentary pressures.

**Initial materials aligned with this principle:**
- Matthew 16:24–26
- Song: “Breakdown” by Andrew Ripp
- Sacrament meeting talk on trust and stillness
- Personal journal reflections on repentance and growth
- Ethical reflections related to policy adherence
