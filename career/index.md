# Professional Overview

I am an IT professional with experience supporting large, security-sensitive environments and leading initiatives that strengthen how systems and people interact. I have helped design and implement identity and authentication processes that improved consistency, security, and trust for those I support. I approach technology as a form of stewardship, recognizing that the work I do affects real people and carries ethical responsibility. As I continue my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology with a focus on security, I aim to combine technical competence with integrity, humility, and service, using what I learn to protect others and contribute in meaningful ways.

### Projects

#### MobilePass+ MFA Enrollment & Service Desk Enablement

Leading the MobilePass+ enrollment initiative required balancing technical precision with responsibility for the people affected by the change. I designed Service Desk operational support, created roles and documentation, and audited enrollment data to identify gaps across more than a thousand members. When I discovered that process ambiguity on my part had contributed to missed enrollments, I took ownership and personally ensured affected members received the tools they needed. This experience reinforced for me that stewardship is not limited to designing secure systems, but includes accountability when outcomes fall short. Owning mistakes promptly and correcting them became as important as the technical success of the project itself.

####  Identity Verification Framework
The Identity Verification Framework was developed to bring consistency and clarity to how identity was confirmed during support interactions. Technically, this meant designing a structured decision model, piloting it, and refining it through feedback until it aligned with organizational standards. Personally, the project reshaped how I thought about trust. Verifying identity is not about suspicion, but about protecting both the individual and the institution. Working on this framework helped me see security controls as expressions of care rather than barriers, and reinforced the importance of exercising judgment with patience, fairness, and respect for others.

#### eToken Security Template Update & Password Compliance Initiative
Updating eToken security templates and enforcing new password requirements involved coordinating with several hundred members and guiding them through changes that were necessary but inconvenient. The technical work was straightforward; the human side was not. Members had varying levels of understanding, urgency, and frustration. This project taught me the value of patience and clarity in service. I learned that compliance achieved through coercion is fragile, while compliance built through explanation and respect is durable. The experience strengthened my appreciation for service as a disciplined effort to help others do difficult but important things, even when appreciation is not immediate.
