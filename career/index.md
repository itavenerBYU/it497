*Several projects in this section involve security-sensitive systems and user data. To uphold ethical and professional obligations, original internal documentation, system identifiers, and screenshots are not included.*

### MobilePass+ MFA Enrollment & Service Desk Enablement

#### Project Overview

I led the Service Desk enablement and enrollment oversight for a MobilePass+ multi-factor authentication rollout in a security-sensitive environment. I designed operational support workflows, defined Service Desk roles and responsibilities, and created documentation to guide enrollment and troubleshooting. I also reviewed and audited enrollment data to identify gaps affecting more than a thousand members. When I identified that ambiguity in my own processes had contributed to missed enrollments, I took responsibility and personally followed up to ensure affected members received access. The project reinforced that effective security implementation requires not only technical accuracy, but accountability for outcomes and willingness to correct failures when they occur.

#### Integration of Technical Skills and Spiritual Growth

This project required applying technical skills related to MFA enrollment lifecycle management, Service Desk workflow design, documentation, and large-scale enrollment data analysis. Implementing multi-factor authentication at scale introduced disruption for many users, and resolving enrollment gaps required sustained communication, follow-through, and adaptability. Working through these challenges helped me better understand service as an active commitment to support others through change, not just a technical deliverable to be completed. Addressing missed enrollments reinforced the importance of responsiveness, clear communication, and personal responsibility when technical decisions affect large groups. Through this experience, I grew in my understanding that service in technology often means meeting people where they are, guiding them through unfamiliar processes, and remaining accountable long after initial implementation is complete.

###  Identity Verification Framework

#### Project Overview

I led the development of the Identity Verification Framework to bring consistency and clarity to how identity was confirmed during support interactions. I designed a structured decision model, piloted it during live support scenarios, and refined it through feedback until it aligned with organizational standards. This framework reduced ambiguity for Service Desk staff, improved consistency across identity verification interactions, and provided clear guidance for handling edge cases where judgment was required.

#### Integration of Technical Skills and Spiritual Growth

Leading the Identity Verification Framework required applying concrete technical skills, including requirements analysis, decision-model design, procedural documentation, and judgment-based escalation handling during live support interactions. Translating policy into an operational framework forced me to think carefully about how rules are applied to individuals in moments of stress or urgency. As I worked through edge cases and real support scenarios, I learned that consistency and security must be balanced with patience and fairness. This project deepened my understanding of care and service in a technical role. Protecting systems is inseparable from protecting people, and exercising administrative authority well requires humility, restraint, and an intentional focus on serving others rather than simply enforcing controls.

### eToken Security Template Update & Password Compliance Initiative

#### Project Overview

I updated eToken security templates and supported the rollout of new password compliance requirements affecting several hundred members. The changes were required to meet updated security standards but created inconvenience for users with varying levels of technical understanding, availability, and urgency. While the technical implementation was straightforward, coordinating communication and supporting compliance at scale required sustained attention.

#### Integration of Technical Skills and Spiritual Growth

This project required applying technical skills related to security template updates, password policy enforcement, service desk communication, and large-scale user coordination. Enforcing updated password requirements across several hundred members highlighted how even routine security changes can create confusion, resistance, and frustration when they interrupt established habits. Supporting members through these changes required clear written guidance, patient follow-up, and consistent messaging, especially when urgency and understanding varied widely. Working through this effort reinforced my understanding that effective security depends as much on communication and trust as on technical correctness. I learned that compliance driven by pressure is often temporary, while compliance built through explanation and respect is more sustainable. This experience broadened my view of stewardship in a technical role by emphasizing restraint, accountability, and a willingness to support others through necessary but inconvenient changes, even when the work is repetitive and appreciation is limited.

## Applied Systems Projects

### Cortex-A72 Smart Home Hub Architecture

#### Project Overview



This project involved designing a smart home monitoring hub built around a low-power ARM Cortex-A72 CPU. The design outlined the system across four abstraction layers, from hardware through user interaction, to demonstrate how architectural decisions support performance, energy efficiency, and security in an always-on environment. The solution integrated multiple wireless protocols, including WiFi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, and used FreeRTOS to provide deterministic response for real-time device control. OpenHAB served as the application layer, enabling centralized automation, third-party integration, and secure user interaction through mobile devices and voice assistants. The paper analyzed system cohesion through concrete workflows, such as adjusting a thermostat schedule and processing a doorbell event, to show how signals move reliably through each layer of the architecture. *[Open the PDF](computer-architecture_ian-tavener.pdf)*

#### Integration of Technical Skills and Spiritual Growth

This project required applying technical skills in computer architecture, embedded system design, abstraction modeling, and security-aware planning. Designing the system before any implementation forced me to confront how much responsibility exists at the design stage, where assumptions are made without the feedback of real users or operational constraints. Working through each abstraction layer highlighted the need for humility and care in technical decision-making, recognizing that early architectural choices can quietly shape security, privacy, and usability long after the system is built. This experience helped me reflect on patience and restraint as forms of growth, particularly the discipline of thinking through consequences rather than optimizing only for capability or novelty. It reinforced the idea that good technical work begins with careful judgment, an awareness of impact, and a willingness to prioritize long-term goals.

### Heritage Vault 2.0 - Linux System Design

#### Project Overview

This project involved designing a Linux-based infrastructure to support FamilySearch’s Heritage Vault 2.0 initiative, a platform responsible for preserving and serving genealogical records at global scale. The system design addressed automation, identity management, storage architecture, security hardening, networking, and virtualization to ensure reliability, scalability, and long-term maintainability. The architecture emphasized consistent configuration through automation, centralized administrative control, hardened security boundaries, and resilient storage and network design. A key refinement to the project introduced explicit data stewardship principles, clarifying how sensitive records are protected, accessed, audited, and recovered over time. The resulting design presents a cohesive operational model focused on durability, accountability, and sustained service. *[Open the PDF](advanced-linux_ian-tavener.pdf)*

#### Integration of Technical Skills and Spiritual Growth

This project required applying advanced technical skills in Linux system administration, automation, security architecture, access control, and operational design. Unlike conceptual design work, this effort emphasized discipline in execution and consistency over time, where small lapses can quietly undermine reliability or trust. Designing systems that must remain stable, secure, and recoverable reinforced the importance of restraint, order, and faithfulness in routine responsibilities. Much of the work focused on preventing failure rather than showcasing innovation, which required patience and a willingness to prioritize integrity over convenience. This experience deepened my understanding that service in a technical role often involves unseen, repetitive effort and careful judgment, carried out with the expectation that the work matters even when it is unnoticed. It strengthened my appreciation for responsibility as a sustained commitment to protect what has been entrusted, day after day.
